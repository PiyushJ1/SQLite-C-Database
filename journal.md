# SQLite Database in C Dev Log

**Building a SQLite-like database in C, following https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/ to understand and apply core low-level concepts. My aim is to learn how databases work at a deeper level and then extend this foundation by adding my own features, such as (planned): Query Parser Improvements, B-Tree indexing, and Persisting to Disk in a binary format.**

## Day 1 - 9/6/25
**What I worked on:**  
-

**What I learned:**  
- 

**What challenges I faced:**  
- The getline() function does not exist in C99, so I could not simply use this function to read user input. Instead, I had to implement the function manually using fgets and use dynamic memory allocation. 

**Next steps:**
