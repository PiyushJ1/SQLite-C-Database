# SQLite Clone Dev Log

**Planning to build a SQLite-like database in C, following the https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/ to understand and apply core low-level concepts. My aim is to learn how databases work at a deeper level and then extend this foundation by adding my own features, such as (planned): Query Parser Improvements, B-Tree indexing, and Persisting to Disk in a binary format.**
